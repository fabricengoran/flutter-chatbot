The sisters respond in very different ways to the occupation with one ultimately joining the Resistance and putting her life on the line for freedom. A popular book for all generations, The Nightingale is a must-read for anyone who loves historical fiction and cheers for the underdog.",
                "In this novel, a lonely and sad old man hides behind a grumpy exterior, leading his neighbors to call him the bitter neighbor from hell, but it all changes when chatty young neighbors with young children move next door to him. At times funny and at other times breathtakingly heartbreaking, A Man Called Ove explores the power of intergenerational friendship and makes us want to love our neighbors a little bit better.",
                "This non-fiction read will appeal to those who enjoyed Unbroken and Seabiscuit by Laura Hilenbrand. The dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler’s 1936 Berlin Olympics, the author draws from the boys’ own diaries and journals to share their remarkable story about beating the odds and finding hope in desperate times.",
                "Henrietta Lacks, known by scientists as HeLa, was a poor Southern tobacco farmer whose cells were taken without her knowledge and ultimately became one of the most important tools in modern medicine. The first \"immortal\" human cells grown in culture are still alive today, even though Henrietta Lacks passed away more than 60 years ago. Skloot takes the reader on an extraordinary journey, breaking down hard to understand scientific principles, and leading the reader to question the origins and ethics of modern medicine.",
                "Set in the English countryside in 1950, this book is an old-fashioned mystery novel and is the first book in a 10-book series. The main character is an 11-year-old amateur sleuth and chemist who uses her skills to clear her father of a murder charge. Although the main character is a child, the style and tone of writing and the powerful character development makes this a great read for anyone who loves vintage traditional crime novels."
